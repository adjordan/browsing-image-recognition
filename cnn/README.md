# browsing-image-recognition
A project to detect classes of images seen based on internet browsing history.

The goals of the project are as follows:

1.) Collect the browsing history of a user (not just from browsers, but all inbound internet traffic)

2.) Process each image on each page into a feature vector

3.) Use a neural network to classify the image as a hit or miss
